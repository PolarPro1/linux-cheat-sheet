Example Questions 

Gives the name of the first directory (alphabetically) of / that has no read permission for other.
find / -maxdepth 1 -type d -not -perm /o=r -print | sort | head -n 1 

Create a symbolic link so that the file /usr/share/dict/words appears as /root/words

Change the owner of the file /etc/ntp.conf to operator

Change the SELinux type

get the default SELinux security context for the specified path from the file contexts configuration

Search for allow rules that are affected by a specific Boolean
sesearch --allow --bool [BOOLEAN_NAME]

The syslog daemon you investigated is allowed to open a number of ports, both tcp and udp. Use the sesearch on the syslogd_t type, focusing on tcp sockets and the name_bind permission. Include the -C to better understand conditional rules.
You should ignore rules where the line begins with DT or DF. This indicates the conditional rule is currently disabled.
sesearch -s syslogd_t -c tcp_socket -AC -p name_bind | grep -vE "^(DT|DF)"

***FIREWALL LINUXZOO LAB***
adds a rule to the iptables firewall that drops (rejects) any incoming TCP packets on port 80 (HTTP) that arrive on the <main_interface> network interface.
iptables -A INPUT -i <main_interface> -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP

adds a rule to the iptables firewall that drops (rejects) any incoming TCP packets from the source IP address range 20.0.0.0/24 that arrive on the main network device specified by <main_interface>
iptables -A INPUT -i <main_interface> -s 20.0.0.0/24 -p tcp -j DROP

any packet that is passed through the FORWARD chain will be rejected with the default settings
iptables -A FORWARD -j REJECT

inserts a new rule at the beginning of the INPUT chain that drops (rejects) any incoming ICMP echo requests (PING). This means that any PING that matches the criteria specified in the rule will be dropped (rejected)
iptables -I INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP

inserts a new rule at the beginning of the INPUT chain that accepts incoming ICMP echo requests (PING) at a rate limit of 1 PING per second. This means that any PING that matches the criteria specified in the rule will be accepted, as long as it does not exceed the rate limit
iptables -I INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -m limit --limit 1/second -j ACCEPT

log incoming pings that are faster than 1 per second
iptables -I INPUT 2 -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -m limit --limit 1/second -j LOG --log-prefix "Ping log: "

To insert a single rule at the start of the INPUT chain that only allows telnet connections from 10.200.0.1 and rejects any other telnet connections, you can use the following command:
iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport telnet ! -s 10.200.0.1 -j REJECT
